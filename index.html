        <h3>Pacers win Game 1 of NBA Finals on Last Minute Buzzer Beater</h3>

        <p>In Game 1 of the 2025 NBA Finals, the Indiana Pacers pulled off a dramatic 111 to 110 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder, thanks to a clutch jumper from Tyrese Haliburton with just 0.3 seconds left on the clock. Despite struggling early—committing 19 turnovers in the first half and trailing by 15 points in the fourth quarter—the Pacers managed a historic comeback to steal the victory.

        Haliburton, who ended the night with 14 points, 10 rebounds, and 6 assists, delivered when it mattered most, giving Indiana its first and only lead of the game at the buzzer. Pascal Siakam added a solid 19-point, 10-rebound double-double, and Obi Toppin provided a big lift off the bench with 17 points.

        The Thunder were led by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who scored a game-high 38 points and kept Oklahoma City in control for most of the night. But the team faltered in the closing minutes, allowing Indiana to take advantage and swing momentum.

        This win marks one of the biggest fourth-quarter comebacks in NBA Finals history and gives the Pacers a 1to 0 lead in the series. Game 2 will also be held in Oklahoma City, where the Thunder will look to bounce back.</p>

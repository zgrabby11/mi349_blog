        <h3>Pacers win Game 1 of NBA Finals on Last Minute Buzzer Beater</h3>

        <p>In Game 1 of the 2025 NBA Finals, the Indiana Pacers pulled off a dramatic 111 to 110 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder, thanks to a clutch jumper from Tyrese Haliburton with just 0.3 seconds left on the clock. Despite struggling early—committing 19 turnovers in the first half and trailing by 15 points in the fourth quarter—the Pacers managed a historic comeback to steal the victory.

        Haliburton, who ended the night with 14 points, 10 rebounds, and 6 assists, delivered when it mattered most, giving Indiana its first and only lead of the game at the buzzer. Pascal Siakam added a solid 19-point, 10-rebound double-double, and Obi Toppin provided a big lift off the bench with 17 points.

        The Thunder were led by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who scored a game-high 38 points and kept Oklahoma City in control for most of the night. But the team faltered in the closing minutes, allowing Indiana to take advantage and swing momentum.

        This win marks one of the biggest fourth-quarter comebacks in NBA Finals history and gives the Pacers a 1to 0 lead in the series. Game 2 will also be held in Oklahoma City, where the Thunder will look to bounce back.</p>

        <p>In Game 1 of the 2025 Stanley Cup Final, the Edmonton Oilers pulled off a dramatic 4 to 3 overtime win over the Florida Panthers at Rogers Place, taking an early lead in the series. Leon Draisaitl scored twice, including the game-winner on a power play with just 31 seconds left in overtime—his first two goals in a Stanley Cup Final.

        Edmonton struck first, but Florida responded quickly and aggressively. Sam Bennett scored twice, and Brad Marchand added another to give the Panthers a 3 to 1 advantage midway through the second period. The Oilers, however, refused to back down. Viktor Arvidsson narrowed the deficit with a goal late in the second, and defenseman Mattias Ekholm, returning from injury, tied the game early in the third period with his first postseason goal.

        Connor McDavid played a pivotal role in the comeback, recording assists on both the tying and game-winning goals, boosting his playoff assist total to 22. Goalie Stuart Skinner also came up big, stopping 29 shots, including several key saves in the final period and overtime.

        Florida had been strong in closing out games throughout the playoffs but could not hold off Edmontons surge in the final frame. Their defensive breakdowns and penalties late in the game opened the door for the Oilers to capitalize.

        With the win, Edmonton goes up 1 to 0 in the best-of-seven series. Game 2 is set for Friday night, again in Edmonton, where the Oilers will look to build momentum before the series shifts to Florida.</p>
